I would first like to thank my brother Rohan for his significant contributions
to much of the work presented in this thesis. I would also like to thank
my advisor, Professor Borivoje Nikoli\'{c}, for his advice and unwavering support.
I would like to further thank Dan Fritchman, Arya Reais-Parsi, and Aviral Pandey
for their ideas and discussion on automation for circuit design, as well as for
writing some of the software libraries from which Substrate draws inspiration.
I would like to thank Felicia Guo, for designing the StrongARM latches used in SRAM22;
Harrison Liew, for helping set up tools for integrating SRAM22 into digital flows; and
Nayiri Krzysztofowicz, for exercising these digital flows.
I would like to thank Brian Richards, for his help over the years in resolving
issues with infrastructure and permissions.
