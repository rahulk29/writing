\section{Conclusion}

\subsection{Additional Features}

Substrate has many features beyond the ones described in this thesis.
In particular, Substrate provides APIs for functional verification
and for verifying digital timing constraints (eg. setup/hold times)
in contexts where analog workflows are more convenient.
The latter feature was used to design and verify a schematic-level tree serializer
generator intended for die-to-die links.

\subsection{Future Work}

There are a wide variety of directions for future work.
We suggest a few here.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Designing an intermediate representation for representing circuits as graph models.
\item Smarter algorithms for analog routing. In particular, it would be nice to have 
an automatic router capable of generating symmetric/matched differential routing,
while understanding which nets are aggressors and which are victims.
\item Easing the process of integrating analog IP into digital flows, a process
that currently requires setting up flows for several tools not often used in a purely-analog workflow.
\end{enumerate}
