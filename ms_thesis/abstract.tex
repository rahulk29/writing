\begin{abstract}

Analog generators are a key component in enabling analog/mixed-signal design
automation, reuse, and optimization.
In this thesis, we present Substrate, a new framework for writing
analog and mixed-signal generators. Substrate offers high performance,
strongly-typed APIs, and a wide set of utilities for schematic entry,
layout entry, and functional verification. We then present SRAM22,
an open-source SRAM generator for the Skywater 130nm open-source process.
We describe how SRAM22 utilizes Substrate features to generate
compact layout, while retaining the flexibility expected from a generator.
