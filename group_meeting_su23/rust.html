# Introduction

# Why Rust is better than Python

--

1. Better performance (both speed and memory).

2. Strong type system catches mistakes at compile time.

3. Built-in documentation, formatting, and linting.

3. Visibility modifiers and structured function signatures encourage clean APIs.

# The Borrow Checker

---

# Borrow checker

The borrow checker verifies a set of rules at compile. It does the magic of ensuring 
that references are always valid (among other things).

--

Here's one set of borrow checking rules:

- Every value has one and only one owner.
- When a value's owner goes out of **scope**, the value is **dropped** (Rust lingo for "freed").
- Can manually drop a value `v` early by calling `drop(v)`.

---

# Scopes

**Scopes** are enclosed in curly braces:
```rust
fn do_stuff() {
  let a = String::from("hello");
  {
    let b = String::from("goodbye");
    // Can access a and b
    // ...
    // b goes out of scope and is dropped
  }
  // Cannot access b here: it is out of scope
  // a is dropped at the end of the function
}
```

Functions, loops, if statements, etc. have their own scope. You can also create nested scopes using curly braces.

---

# Moves

Every value has one owner. Sometimes that owner can change. This is called a **move**.

Assignment moves values. This is invalid:
```rust
let s1 = String::from("my string");
let s2 = s1;  // Ownership of the string moves from s1 to s2.
// s1 no longer owns the string, so we can't access data via s1.
println!("{}", s1); // This is an error; data has been moved out of s1.
```
--

This is fine:
```rust
let s1 = String::from("my string");
let s2 = s1;  // Ownership of the string moves from s1 to s2.
println!("{}", s2); // This is okay; s2 owns the string now.
```

---

# Cloning

If you need multiple variables to own data, you can `clone` a value:
```rust
let s1 = String::from("my string");
let s2 = s1.clone();  // s2 is a clone of s1
println!("{}", s2); // This is okay; s2 owns its data.
println!("{}", s1); // This is okay; s1 also owns its data.
```
--

Cloning is usually _expensive_, but often happens under the hood in other programming languages.

---

# Other cool features

Rust's borrow checker has a lot of other cool features, a few of which we'll list here:
- Only one reference can have the ability mutate a variable at any given time.
- If references that can't mutate a variable exist, the variable cannot be mutated.
- You can't create references that point to freed data.

# The Type System

---

# Primitive types

* Signed integers: `i8, i16, i32, i64, i128, isize`
* Unsigned integers: `u8, u16, u32, u64, u128, usize`
* Floating point: `f32, f64`
* Boolean: `bool`
* Character: `char` (use single quotes, eg. `'a'`)

---

# Compound types

##### Tuples:

```rust
// The type annotation is unnecessary
let my_tuple: (i32, char, bool) = (162, 'X', true);
let second: char = my_tuple.1; // 'X'
```

--

##### Arrays:

```rust
// Arrays have a fixed size, as indicated in the (optional) type annotation
let nums: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let second = nums[1];
```

--

##### Structs:

```rust
struct Coordinate {
  x: i32,
  y: i32,
}
// ...
let point = Coordinate {
  x: 5,
  y: 3,
};
```

???

No need to remember exact syntax.

---

# Functions

--

A function that squares the input:
```rust
fn square(x: i32) -> i32 {
  return x * x;
}
```

--
Equivalent to:
```rust
fn square(x: i32) -> i32 {
  x * x
}
```


--

If a function does not return a value, just omit the return type:
```rust
fn add_one(x: &mut i32) {
  *x += 1;
}
```

---

# Enums


Enum for different operating systems:
```
enum OperatingSystem {
  Mac,
  Windows,
  Linux,
  Other,
}
```

--

Even better:
```
enum OperatingSystem {
  Mac,
  Windows,
  Linux,
  Other(String)
}

let a = OperatingSystem:Linux;
let b = OperatingSystem:Other("Redox OS".to_string());
```

Enum variants can store data!

---

# `Impl` blocks

Suppose we have the following struct definition (not to be confused with `Vec`):
```
struct Vector {
  x: f64,
  y: f64,
}
```

--

We can add associated methods to a struct/enum using an impl block:

```
impl Vector {
  fn add(&self, other: &Self) -> Self {
    Self {
      x: self.x + other.x,
      y: self.y + other.y,
    }
  }
}

// let (v1, v2) = ...;
let sum = v1.add(&v2);
```

---

# Traits

Traits (similar to interfaces in other languages) define shared behavior.

--

```rust
trait Shape {
  fn area(&self) -> i64;
  fn perimeter(&mut self) -> i64;
}
```

--

Implement a trait:

```
struct Rect {
  x0: i64,
  y0: i64,
  x1: i64,
  y1: i64,
}
// Assumes that x1 >= x0 and y1 >= y0
impl Shape for Rect {
  fn area(&self) -> i64 {
    (self.x1 - self.x0) * (self.y1 - self.y0)
  }
  fn perimeter(&mut self) -> i64 {
    2 * (self.x1 - self.x0 + self.y1 - self.y0)
  }
}
```

---

# Generics

Generics allow you to write code that works for many types.

--

For example:
```rust
fn example1<T1>(arg1: T1) {
  // arg1 has type T1; T1 can be any type.
}
```

--

The function above accepts any type `T1`.
What if we want it to only work on some smaller set of types?

---

# Trait bounds

Here's an example:

```rust
fn say_hello<T>(x: T) -> String
where
    T: std::fmt::Display,
{
    format!("Hello, {}!", x)
}
```

--

This function only accepts types that can be printed ("Display"ed in Rust lingo).

# Substrate examples

---

# Process specificity

To declare that a block has a schematic in a particular PDK,
it must implement `HasSchematic<PDK>`.

You can implement `HasSchematic<PDK>` multiple times if you
support multiple PDKs.

--

When describing the schematic of a block in `PDK1`, the type system
only allows you to instantiate blocks that also have a schematic in `PDK1`.

Here's the relevant method signature:

```rust
pub fn instantiate<I: HasSchematic<PDK>>(&mut self, block: I) -> Instance<I> {
  // ...
}
```

---

# Process specificity (cont.)

As a brief example from Substrate:

```
impl HasSchematic<Sky130OpenPdk> for Inverter {
  fn schematic(
      &self,
      io: &<<Self as Block>::Io as substrate::io::SchematicType>::Bundle,
      cell: &mut substrate::schematic::CellBuilder<PDK, Self>,
  ) -> substrate::error::Result<Self::Data> {
      let nmos = cell.instantiate(Nfet01v8::new((self.nw, self.lch)));
      cell.connect(io.dout, nmos.io().d);
      cell.connect(io.din, nmos.io().g);
      cell.connect(io.vss, nmos.io().s);
      cell.connect(io.vss, nmos.io().b);

      let pmos = cell.instantiate(Pfet01v8::new((self.pw, self.lch)));
      cell.connect(io.dout, pmos.io().d);
      cell.connect(io.din, pmos.io().g);
      cell.connect(io.vdd, pmos.io().s);
      cell.connect(io.vdd, pmos.io().b);

      Ok(())
  }
}
```

--

Attempting to instantiate MOS devices from a different PDK would result in a compile time error.

---

# Process specificity (cont.)

For truly process portable devices, such as a voltage divider that uses only ideal resistors,
a **blanket implementation** can be used.

```
impl<PDK: Pdk> HasSchematic<PDK> for Vdivider {
  fn schematic(
      &self,
      io: &VdividerIoSchematic,
      cell: &mut CellBuilder<PDK, Self>,
  ) -> substrate::error::Result<Self::Data> {
      let r1 = cell.instantiate(Resistor::new(100));
      let r2 = cell.instantiate(Resistor::new(100));

      cell.connect(io.pwr.vdd, r1.io().p);
      cell.connect(io.out, r1.io().n);
      cell.connect(io.out, r2.io().p);
      cell.connect(io.pwr.vss, r2.io().n);
      Ok(VdividerData { r1, r2 })
  }
}

```

--

Attempting to instantiate devices specific to a single PDK would throw a compiler error.

---

# Schematic ports

Blocks declare the type of their I/O at compile time:

```rust
pub struct MosIo {
  pub d: InOut<Signal>,
  pub g: Input<Signal>,
  pub s: InOut<Signal>,
  pub b: InOut<Signal>,
}
```

```rust
let nmos = cell.instantiate(Nfet01v8::new((self.nw, self.lch)));
cell.connect(io.dout, nmos.io().d);
cell.connect(io.din, nmos.io().g);
cell.connect(io.vss, nmos.io().s);
cell.connect(io.vss, nmos.io().b);
```

If you did something like
```rust
cell.connect(io.dout, nmos.io().drain);
```
you'd get a compiler error: there is no "drain" port in `MosIo`.

You can also get autocomplete in your IDE!
No need to open up a separate tab to remind yourself what the port names are.

---

# Nested Nodes

You often want to probe the internal nodes of a circuit.

Typically do this by writing something along the lines of

```python
output = run_tran_simulation(...);
output.get_data("v(xdut.xr1.n)")
```

But this is brittle and hard to maintain:
* How do you know what signals `xr1` contains?
* What if the name of `xr1` changes (perhaps to `r1`)?
* Are names case sensitive?

---

# Nested Nodes

This is how you do the same thing in Substrate.
First, define what data each block exposes. For example:

```rust
#[derive(SchematicData)]
pub struct VdividerData {
    #[substrate(nested)]
    r1: Instance<Resistor>,
    #[substrate(nested)]
    r2: Instance<Resistor>,
}
```

The `nested` attribute tells Substrate to form hierarchical paths.

Next, get the probed value from your simulator's output:
```rust
let output = run_tran_simulation(...);
output.get_data(&dut.data().r1.terminals().n)
```

If the name `r1` changes, or if it stops exposing a terminal called `n`,
your code won't compile! No need to run the generator to find bugs.

---

# Caching

Generators often run time-consuming simulations.

End-to-end generators are better than piece-by-piece generators.
But without caching, you needlessly re-run early steps when all
you care about is the later steps.
  
Substrate caches simulator calls, so you can write end-to-end
generators at the same speed you'd write piece-by-piece generators.

The cache API allows you to cache anything that can be serialized to disk (i.e. not just simulations).

You can specify multiple cache providers, and cache providers can be either
local (on disk) or remote (served over HTTP).
So caches can be shared across people working in the same project group, research group, etc.

---

# Documentation

Rust automatically generates documentation for everything and can be supplemented with doc-comments.
The linter can also be told to enforce documentation by specifying `#![warn(missing_docs)]`.

You end up with documentation like [this](https://api.substratelabs.io/sky130pdk/mos/struct.Nfet01v8.html), which makes finding the properties of any construct simple.
